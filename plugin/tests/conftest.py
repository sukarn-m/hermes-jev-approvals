"""Keep executable test scripts out of pytest's import-time collector.

The scripts predate pytest and intentionally run assertions at module scope.  Importing all
of them in one pytest process makes their environment/module stubs leak between files, while
Hermes-dependent scripts cannot be collected on machines without Hermes core.  The pytest
suite runs the offline scripts in isolated subprocesses instead (test_scripts.py).
