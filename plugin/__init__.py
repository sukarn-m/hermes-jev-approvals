"""jev-approvals — TypeSafe's Jev decision model as Hermes' smart-approval reviewer.

The PLUGIN is `jev-approvals` (what it does); the PROVIDER it registers is `typesafe-jev`
(what goes in `auxiliary.approval.provider`). Those are independent: providers/ discovery
only checks `kind: model-provider` and imports the directory, and the ProviderProfile below
decides the provider name.

APPROVALS ONLY. This provider serves exactly one auxiliary task
(`auxiliary.approval`) and refuses everything else, because Jev emits no strings and
therefore cannot do chat.

Why it exists: `approvals.mode: smart` sends every flagged command to an auxiliary LLM
(tools/approval_smart.py) that must answer with one word — APPROVE, DENY, or ESCALATE.
That is a three-option Choice wearing a chat completion's clothes: a full reasoning
model spun up to emit one token a regex then parses back out.

In one v0.2.0-era baseline of 156 real commands mined from this machine's own session history,
both routes ran through core's real _smart_approve:

    aux chat LLM              114/0/42 approve/deny/escalate   3968ms avg  619s total
    this provider + policy    144/2/10                          405ms avg   63s total

That baseline was 9.8x faster with 4.2x fewer human interruptions; it is not a universal
speedup. An independent v0.2.1 live-sandbox study measured 1.24x reviewer time against a
different model/corpus. No core changes: Hermes already resolves
each auxiliary task's provider from config (agent/auxiliary_client.py::
_resolve_task_provider_model) and accepts plugin-registered providers.

TWO ROUTES, selected by `base_url` — no plugin-specific config:

    # TypeSafe direct (default)
    auxiliary:
      approval:
        provider: typesafe-jev
        model: jev-latest

    # via OpenRouter, which also hosts Jev at the same published price
    auxiliary:
      approval:
        provider: typesafe-jev
        model: ~typesafe/jev-latest
        base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha

Core passes `api_key` and `base_url` to `create_client` (auxiliary_client.py:5128), and
leaves both URLs untouched, so the endpoint is derived from the host: `openrouter.ai` uses
`/decisions`, anything else `/systemone`. Both return the identical typed answer shape.

    sends that credential anywhere (see _api_key: a non-TypeSafe host uses ONLY the
    settings.key_env variable), so the variable would otherwise have to hold a fake value
    in .env forever.
